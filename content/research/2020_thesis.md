abstract = "This paper studies how elite purges affect local ofﬁcials’ repression of mass protests in authoritarian regimes. I propose a selective repression mechanism: local ofﬁcials, fearing purge, strengthen repression of more threatening protests while tolerating less threatening ones so as to comply with the autocrat’s preference. Perception of purge threat affects this choice. Using data on Chinese labor protests and two-way ﬁxed effect models that exploit temporal variation in purges across 327 Chinese cities, from 2011 to 2018, I ﬁnd purges increase the likelihood of local ofﬁcials’ repression of labor protests with more participants and those demanding social rights. Patron-connected ofﬁcials exercise intensiﬁed selective repression due to stronger perception of purge threat."
