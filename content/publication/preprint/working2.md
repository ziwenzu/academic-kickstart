abstract: What create the democratic thoughts in an autocracy? What are the effects of media in political persuasions under authoritarian rules? This research utilizes an online survey experiment conducted in 2015 on China’s social media platforms to detect the causal links between media frames and democratic ideology. We employ a logit model ﬁnding that (i) frames are only signiﬁcant when given availability, accessibility and applicability that connect media and democracy. Otherwise weak frames are not effective. (ii) established ideology, and prior media beliefs are the most important determinants of netizens’ attitudes towards democracy (iii) speciﬁcally, pro-democracy frame lowers the regime support to some extent but the overall authoritarian rules maintain stable. Finally, we step further using an ordinal model to explore what factors inﬂuence ideology.
