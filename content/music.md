In addition to doing political science research and data analysis and such, I like to write and record music. I'm currently recording through an Axe-Fx II, Focusrite Scarlett 2i2, and Cubase 10. I write music for [The Water Chestnuts](https://www.instagram.com/thewaterchestnuts/?hl=en), and we have a demo and single [here](https://thewaterchestnuts.bandcamp.com/).
