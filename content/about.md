Hello! 

My name is Gary and I am a Ph.D. student in Political Science at University of California, San Diego. I received a Bachelor of Management in pubic administration from Sun Yat-Sen University in 2018. During 2018-2020, I conducted research and completed graduate coursework at Duke University, where I obtained a Master of Arts in political science.

My academic interests encompass political institutions, political economy and statistical methods, with a particular focus on China and authoritarian regimes. 

During my spare time, I enjoy movies, literature, sci-fiction novels and learning history from archeology.

My CV can be found [here](/zu.pdf).
