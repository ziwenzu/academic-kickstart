Hello! 

My name is Thomas and I am a pre-doctoral fellow with J-PAL's [Payments and Governance Research Program](https://sites.google.com/ucsd.edu/pgrp/home?authuser=0). I received a Bachelor of Science in political science and data analytics from UC San Diego in 2020. 

I have served as a research assistant for the Center for the Study of African Political Economy and as a lab assistant for the [Center for Peace and Security Studies](https://cpass.ucsd.edu/).

I am interested in political institutions, elections, secession, and conflict in developing democracies, with a particular focus in sub-Saharan Africa. 

My CV can be found [here](/tb.pdf).
