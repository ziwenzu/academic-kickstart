<p>Thesis progress is slow but rewarding. I have a skeleton of my thesis and am working dilligently to fill out the rest of it. One thing that I have to show is my power-sharing ontology. It’s a jargon-y word, I know, but it’s a fun concept to implement in R.</p>
<div id="ontology" class="section level1">
<h1>Ontology</h1>
<p>Ontology is just a fancy word for family-tree. An ontology helps to visualize the relationship between upper-nodes and lower-nodes; parents and children. Imagine that I am node-0, my parents are node-1, and their parents (my grandparents) are the second node—its just a way of mapping hierarchical relationships. I use this idea to map out existing conceptions of power-sharing, where “concepts of power-sharing” is node-0, the broad form (i.e. consociational democracy, inclusive power-sharing, partition, power-dividng etc.) is the first node, and the second node denotes the components of power-sharing. That is, the mechanisms that make up the broad forms of power-sharing: segmental autonomy, mutual veto, coalition cabinets, and so on. During my literature review portion of the thesis, I made an Excel sheet of all the different conceptions of power-sharing. The code below is a nice example of how to visualize ontologies using this data.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the data:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>head(psp_ont_prep, 20)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 20 x 3
##    child_0         child_1                   provisions                         
##    &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;chr&gt;                     &lt;chr&gt;                              
##  1 political syst… general consocilationali… grand coalition                    
##  2 political syst… general consocilationali… mutual veto                        
##  3 political syst… general consocilationali… proportionality                    
##  4 political syst… general consocilationali… segmental autonomy                 
##  5 political syst… general consocilationali… coalition cabinets                 
##  6 political syst… general consocilationali… bicameralism                       
##  7 political syst… general consocilationali… proportional representation        
##  8 political syst… general consocilationali… organized interest groups          
##  9 political syst… general consocilationali… rigid constitution                 
## 10 political syst… general consocilationali… judicial review                    
## 11 political syst… general consocilationali… direct democracy                   
## 12 political syst… general consocilationali… neutral head of state              
## 13 political syst… general consocilationali… referendums                        
## 14 political syst… general consocilationali… independent central bank           
## 15 political syst… general consocilationali… balance of power                   
## 16 political syst… general consocilationali… government leader as primus inter …
## 17 political syst… general consocilationali… proportional employment            
## 18 political syst… general consocilationali… decentralized/federal government   
## 19 political syst… corporate consociational… balance of power                   
## 20 political syst… corporate consociational… predetermination of power positions</code></pre>
<p>Now we have to specify which column belongs where in the family-tree:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Generate pathString as new column
psp_ont_prep$pathString &lt;- paste(&quot;Power Sharing Provision&quot;,
                             psp_ont_prep$child_0,
                             psp_ont_prep$child_1,
                             psp_ont_prep$provisions,
                             sep = &quot;|&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Now, using the awesome data.tree package, we format the data to work with equally awesome networkD3 package:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Create list 
psp_tree &lt;- data.tree::as.Node(psp_ont_prep, pathDelimiter = &quot;|&quot;)

print(psp_tree, limit = 15)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##                                  levelName

<pre class="r"><code>psp_list &lt;- data.tree::ToListExplicit(psp_tree, unname = TRUE)</code></pre>
<p>Now we use networkD3 to create the visualization. There is a lot of flexibility in terms of formatting your plots, and you can mix networkD3 with htmlwidgets to add titles and captions to your plots.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Create visualization

<p>So here is the visualization of my literature review efforts for the senior thesis. As you can see, there are a lot of competing, and often overlapping, conceptions of power-sharing. I believe this visualization provides ample evidence of the need to disaggregate power-sharing, and study the “lower nodes” in order to establish its effectiveness.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to the code. Saving networkD3 plots is somewhat odd, so if anyone has any suggestions on alternatives, do let me know. Essentially, you save the plot as an .html file and then take a snapshot of the .html file using the webshot package. See below:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Save visualizations
### networkD3::saveNetwork(psp_ontology_vis, file = paste0(here::here(), &#39;/vis/psp_ontology_vis.html&#39;))

### webshot::webshot(&quot;file:///C:/Users/yourusername/folder/folder/folder/vis/psp_ontology_vis.html&quot;, paste0(here::here(), &quot;/vis/psp_ontology_vis.png&quot;))</code></pre>
