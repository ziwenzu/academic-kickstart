<p>I was fortunate enough to have been invited into the political science honors program at UC San Diego. As part of the program, I am required to write a thesis on a topic of my choosing. The program consists of a weekly three-hour seminar, plus regular meeting with an advisor, and I will have two quarters to complete the paper.</p>
<p>I am incredibly lucky to have Professors Kaare Strom and Daniel Butler leading the seminar, and <a href="https://garethnellis.github.io/">Professor Gareth Nellis</a> as my thesis advisor. I have looked up to these professors throughout my undergraduate career and cannot wait to work with them.</p>

<h1>Focus</h1>
<p>My thesis will focus on power-sharing. My central argument is that existing studies of power-sharing use different conceptualizations and measurements which hinder cumulative findings. As the literature stands, we cannot really understand the effectiveness of power-sharing as it relates to prolonged peace and democratization. Moreover, most studies use the two aforementioned dependent variables to establish power-sharing’s effectiveness, which is limiting. I propose a disaggregated approach to studying power-sharing. By studying the components of power-sharing arragements, we may better understand it’s effectiveness as well as the mechanisms which drive its success and failure. I also intend to expand how we evaluate power-sharing by adding an additional dependent variable—social trust—into the mix.</p>
<p>In addition to measuring the substantive effects of one component of power-sharing (to be determined), I also plan on creating an ontology of the current conceptions of power-sharing to see if and where these components overlap.</p>
<p>I am currently in the literature review portion of the project, and am diving into the power-sharing literature, case-study analyses, and am brushing up on statistics and econometrics.</p>
<p>More to follow!</p>
